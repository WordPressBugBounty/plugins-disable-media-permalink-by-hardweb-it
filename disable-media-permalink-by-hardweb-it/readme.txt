== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How it works? =

When the Plugin is active, it apply a filter to say to your WP to disable all media permalinks.
So every link like this: https://mydomain.com/category/the-post-title/attachment/my-image-slug
come back to: https://mydomain.com/wp-content/uploads/12/01/my-image.jpg

= What happen when a previous permalink will open?

Since WP will no longer check these type of guid structure the old permalink will return a 404 page.

= Is this plugin SEO compatible?

Obviously if you disable all media permalink, all of those could be deleted by search engines.
Depend on your SEO plugin, it could convert all media permalink to the direct file link (see your SEO plugin settings and check the sitemap.xml to understand what it contain).
If you enable the "Redirect attachment URLs to the attachment itself" function, this will stop to work, since the redirect can't work without the media permalink.

= Do the plugin something with database?

No! The plugin never write anything to your wordpress database, so it is 100% safe to use!

= Can I restore all media permalink?
Of course, You can do it with a single click!
* Simply disable or uninstall the plugin
* Your permalink structure and all previous permalink will work again.
